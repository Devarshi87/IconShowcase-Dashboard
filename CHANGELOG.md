# v 1.9.7.6

* The status bar icons will be white when the toolbar is expanded, always. And will be dark or white (depending on how you set it up in dashboard_configuration.xml for every theme), when toolbar is completely collapsed.
	***Note:***
	There's a minor issue that will make the status bar icons appear white even if the toolbar is collapsed enough for them to be dark (when enabled), but this is all I could come with, anyways, I think it works good enough.
